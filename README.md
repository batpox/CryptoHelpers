Utility to experiment with .NET Security modules
I needed to create a a .CER file from a signed .EXE, but I could not find any utilities that didn't use the old Microsoft COM DLL (CAPICOM).
So, I created this small utility to create the certificate using the .NET security software.
It is a WinForms application.
